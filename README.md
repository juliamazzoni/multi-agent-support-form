### AI Agents Integration

#### ✍️ Rewrite Agent
- Rewrites the ticket description to be more engaging, grammatically correct, and easier to understand.
- Preserves the original tone and intent of the user's input.
- Triggered via a dedicated **"Rewrite Description"** button.

#### 🧠 Classification Agent
- Analyzes the description and classifies the ticket by selecting an option for **category**, **priority**, and **related product** from the dropdown.
- Triggered via a **"Auto Classify"** button.
